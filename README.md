# File Sorter

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

**What it does:** This project sorts the files in the computer that it is run on based on the file type. The folders that are being sorted and the file destinations can both be configured to the user's preferences. Moreover, it can also reverse previous sorts, so long as the sort data is still in "fileRecords.txt".

**Building Process:** This was coded in python using both the shutil and os module. It utilizes various OOP principles such as classes, methods, and instances.

**How to use it:** Upon installation, go to the "config.py" file and fill in the respective blank data areas. Once the program is run, if you'd like to undo a previous sort, type "y"; if you'd like to conduct a new sort, type "n".
